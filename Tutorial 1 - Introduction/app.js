 * "Everything in JS, is an Object"
 * 
 * - Objects in JS are quite like objects in real life
 * - They have properties & things they can do methods (just functions associated with that object)
 * 
 * - Null, numbers, billions and strings are NOT objects but primitive types, they can still behave
 * like objects in JavaScript because JavaScript can wrap them in an object when we need to. Will
 * do that "silently" in the background for us
